<h2 class="neonText"> Its been 563 days since I have seen our daughter ##CORAL_IRIS_KELLY. </h2> 
Her mother mother Erika Renee Kelly was kidnapped on Feb 2,2020. A local Atlanta Matt Field bragged about it on Facebook stating "I_SOLD_HER. I found her near Venice beach California and my tattooist Kennie_Davis of ##Jolly_Roger_Tattoo in _Stockbridge#Georgia was not too far from the scene. Erika and I were not estranged when she disappeared as [ESSENCE_MAGAZiNE_STATED](https://www.essence.com/news/erika-kelly-missing-atlanta-georgia/) we were coparenting. I was laid off from my IT job at [Ionic Security](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ionic-security) after my work was repeatedly sabotaged by my manager. I opened a case with ##Fulton_County_Family_Services two months before our eviction from our ##East_Atlanta_Home_at_631_Moreland_Ave_in_Atlanta_Georgia they failed to process us after repeated visits and calls. I took odd jobs and even scored a mural gig with [Mercedes_BenZ_Stadium](https://mercedesbenzstadium.com/) for the [Atlanta_Falcons](https://www.atlantafalcons.com/). They paid me $1500 for a 40ft graffiti mural on red canvas for former athlete ##Deion_Sanders. I was severely underpaid but it covered the rent for one more month. I moved in with Constancia and her daughter ##Akeeva, got Coral in school at [Chapel Hill Elementary](https://www.chapelhilles.dekalb.k12.ga.us/) and worked hard to get a new 9-5.
 
Constancia did not like me or Coral living with her and Akeeva so they undercut me with accusations of erratic behavior and started thier own dfacs case accusing me of schizophrenia. I had no income and was repeatedly denied foodstamps and welfare by a woman named ##DANIELLE_MASHONGA_and_her_colleage##MANESSA_WARNER... ##Coral would ask <h2>##Where_is_mommy?!?</h2>I told her that Matt stole and raped her and she needs our help, so we have to keep looking. Constancia and Akeeva constantly defended Matt. He is a known pedophile and child and adult rapist in the Atlanta art community. I did not know this. We shopped at the same record store and he often offered me work. I loath rapist. I loath pedophilia. Once I learned of his ways I distanced myself. So ##Erikas_mother_and_sisters_DEFENDING_HIM, struck me as bizarre. "##Its_just_a_white_boy_joke##He_didnt_sell_her. [DFACS](https://dfcs.georgia.gov/) stalked me on Facebook and indirectly accused me of ##CHILD_MOLESTATION for a video where we were playing with a wand style muscle massager, it was innocent.  They [forcibly removed Coral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmYdIZhahrQ) saying that I was saying ["inappropriate things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sCE3HhjSbY) and violating her by saying that her mom had been raped and kidnapped. I learned that telling Coral the ugly truth was the best way to keep a solid trust filled relationship with her.
 
In the DFACS meeting, puzzled I told Mashonga the truth, I cant find work, my reputation was being sabotaged and I could not even get a job at ##Kroger the local grocery store. I told Mashonga I needed money for food, Constancia would not feed niether me or Coral. I asked Mashonga in [This_Family_Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8NXhT6_Tx8) if she cared about me dying on the street and she shook her head, no. I was never interviewed with Coral at all, I never got a psych eval until I got to a ##UCLA_Recoup_Center_in_PalmDale_California.
 
In early October I saw Coral, in Pasadena, ##California, with a grown man wearing fishnet stockings... Shes 9. I was shot with a poison dart one day later, my skateboard stolen and my foot began to swell larger that a shoe could fit... I was rushed to the emergency room and ##UCLA ##Cut_my_foot_to_the_bone_to_drain_the_infection... I cant run any more and am now handicapped

## Eric is helping me here
[Eric_Meyer](https://github.com/meyerweb) got me interested in webdesign years ago with what I call his [ Nautilus design](https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/glassy.html). I have always enjoyed graphic arts. After my mother and I were kidnapped, the home I grew up in with her sister and her kidnapper was stocked high with [National Geographic Magazines ](https://lifeasahuman.com/2015/media-tech/media/why-i-save-old-national-geographic-magazines/) and [ Watchtower and AWAKE Magazines](https://vatican.com/The-Americas-Watchtower-Magazines%e2%80%92-Jehovah-Witness/6633/502/4583/g17Watchtower%20Magazines-%20Jehovah%20Witness'e16'1/295/) and being from ##LOS_ANGELES I had a lot of exposure to [graffiti art](https://www.graffiti.org/) and my brothers were [Graffiti Writers](http://www.at149st.com/history.html). So when I got my first exposure to the web in 1997, I wanted in, but had no Idea what to do. After two to three years of infreaquent browsing due to the rarity and scarcity of computers, much less computers with internet connections [SCAD opened its library to the public](https://www.scad.edu/life/buildings-and-facilities/jen-library) and while I wanted to go for graphic design, my foster parents could not affor it. It was about $100,000 for a ##GRAPHIC_DESIGN_DEGREE. ##WiLLiE_KELLY_JR_MY_KIDNAPPER only made around $35,000 a year. Even if he would pay for college it was not even worth asking and SCAD had noprograms for local residents. Eric's Design looked incredible on the library's [Bondi Blue First Generation iMACS](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac_ab.html). That machine was like $1,300 so I could never get one on my own... I struggled to get [The Original Playstation in 1995](https://www.britannica.com/topic/PlayStation), it was only $300. I have never had a new computer of my own. I did use them in corporate... I in someways worked for new computers for years while dealing with ##East_AFRICAN_ISSUES. THis codeblock will  according to Eric, make my site more readable across more platforms >>>

### DATE_iN_FOR_BLOG_iN_RUBY_BROKEN_RN_(syntax_issues_in_Jekyll)
Im experimenting with some code i found in the <em> [Learn Ruby Documentation](https://learnandlearn.com/ruby-programming/ruby-reference/ruby-get-today-or-current-date-today-method-with-examples) To show users the current date. I dont post daily because I own no computer or cellphone, and there is no internet access for patrons of my homeless recoupe center so I cant make time commitments to the blog at this point... However just seeing the date is a little user interaction that lets people know that something is changing... If time is moving, Im progressing offline in someway even if there are no posts. Posting is personal, thanks fo checkin' on me tho. I was scared for a few days that I was being sabatoged again after #MATT_LETRS_FiELD and #ERiKA_MUNA_CORAL_and_SARTUs_KiDNAP_POSSE destroyed me on the social web... My my video links appeared broken at [Best Buy in PalmDale](www.bestbuy.com). When I got to the library all was well. Sometimes network filtering changes what we see... Im going to move to permalinks to see if that changes the results. Its important for all sharing information to see the same thing! </em>

# SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21TH, 2021
# Im working on CSS

Since I'm publishing using [##GiTHUB_PAGES](https://pages.github.com/), alot of administration needs are met from my [GiTHUB_ACCOUNT](https://github.com/ThakaRashard), I can focus on coding. [Cascading Style Sheets is a legit programming language for the browser](http://www.csszengarden.com/216/). Using the site David Shea Started, I can get this Jekyll account to another level. I really need this book [The Zen of CSS](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/565.The_Zen_of_CSS_Design) he published. I have to create navigation to my resume and create a contact page. Im using [GiTHUB Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) to manage individual pages right now because it is a small site and I want [psychological separation](https://www.separationadvice.net/psychological-separation/) which social media does not provide. I was blackballed on Linkedin for just not knowing enough for my age, and my family+romance life. Every woman that committed to me was sold into sex slavery and kidnapped by ##INSTAGRAM_PiMPS_and_MARKETED_iN_FACEBOOK_BROTHELS. They are still trafficked as prostitutes. IT people in the DEVOPS generation often fool themselves into thinking prostitution is normal and the family which is affected is the problem. This view has left people with familes discriminated against in the ##IT_MARKETPLACE, but here in Los Angeles after 2 years of homelessness, I sense my luck changing... So Im working hard to clean up my image and reputation outside social media, which has brought me closer to my family ##I_FOUND_EVERYONE_ALiVE_HERE_IN_SOUTHER_CALIFORNIA.\
